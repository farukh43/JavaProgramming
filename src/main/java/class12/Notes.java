	Polymprphism
	
	one thing can have many form 
	
	shape-  circle ,square,triagnle,rectangle
	Water -- vapour, ice burge etc
	
	we can achieve polymorphism using Overloading
	
	4 rules are applicable:
	--------------------------------

	1.Method names should be the same.
	2.Number of parameters should be different.
	3.Data type of parameters should be different.
	4.Order of parameters should be different.
	//Note - If we change the variable name it does not matter (int a, b) and same method (int x,int y ) does make any difference
	 
	 Encapsulation
	 -------------------------
	 wrapping up of data and methods to in to single unit case (class)
	 
	1.All variables should be private.
	2.For every variable, there should be 2 methods (get & set).
	3.Variables can be operated only through methods.
	
	Can we overload main method?
