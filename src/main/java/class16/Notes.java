	 * Data Abstraction:

	Abstraction is a process of hiding the implementation details and showing only functionality to the user.
	
	1)Abstract Class
	2)Interface:
		
	Interface:
	------------------
	1)An interface is a blueprint of a class.
	2)Interface contains final & static variables.
	3)Interface contains abstract methods (also allowed default methods & static methods from Java 8 onwards).
	4)An abstract method is a method that contains a signature but not a body (unimplemented method).
	5)Methods in an interface are public.
	6)Interface supports the functionality of multiple inheritance.
	7)We can define an interface with the interface keyword.
	8)A class extends another class, an interface extends another interface, but a class implements an interface.
	9)We can create an object reference for an interface but cannot instantiate an interface.
