		 * If you know the number of iterations in advance, the for loop is often the most suitable.
		 * If you want to execute the loop at least once, the do-while loop is appropriate.
		 * If you are uncertain about the number of iterations and the loop termination is based on a condition, the while loop is a good choice.
